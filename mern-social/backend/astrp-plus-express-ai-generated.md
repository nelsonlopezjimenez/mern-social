# Astro and express, good? on chrome 3.18.2025
Yes, using Astro with an Express.js backend can be a good combination, especially for building content-driven websites that prioritize performance and SEO, as Astro can be used as a middleware for Express. 
Here's a breakdown of why:
Astro's Strengths:
Performance: Astro is known for its focus on fast loading times and minimal JavaScript overhead, making it ideal for content-heavy websites. 
SEO: Astro's server-side rendering capabilities (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) ensure that search engines can easily crawl and index your content. 
Flexibility: Astro allows you to use various templating engines (including HTML, JSX, and more) and integrates well with different component frameworks. 
Express.js as a Backend:
Server-Side Logic: Express.js provides a robust framework for handling server-side logic, APIs, and routing. 
Middleware Integration: Astro can be used as middleware within an Express.js application, allowing you to leverage Astro's frontend capabilities while still using Express for backend tasks. 
Existing Ecosystem: If you already have an existing application using Express, integrating Astro as a frontend solution can be relatively straightforward. 
Why it Works Well Together:
Separation of Concerns: You can use Astro for building the frontend and Express for handling the backend, leading to a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. 
Scalability: Express.js's robust features and the ability to scale your application as needed are valuable for larger projects. 
Dynamic Content: While Astro excels at static site generation, you can also use it to render dynamic content on the server using SSR.
