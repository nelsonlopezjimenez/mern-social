# nodejs are cookies tab or browser specific

## AI Overview 3.19.2025

Cookies in Node.js, as in general web development, are browser-specific and not tab-specific. This means that all tabs within the same browser share the same cookies for a given domain. When a server sets a cookie, it's stored by the browser and sent back with subsequent requests to the same domain, regardless of which tab initiated the request.
If you open the same website in multiple tabs of the same browser, all those tabs will have access to the same cookies for that website. This is because cookies are associated with the browser's storage for a specific domain, not with individual tabs.
However, different browsers will have separate cookie storage. For example, cookies set in Chrome will not be accessible in Firefox or Safari.
